# inv_request_prod
Auto Requisition is a specialized custom command-line application that uses data sources, namely the consumption report generated by the CPOE and the current stock on hand generated by the robotic dispensing system.
It asks the user for the days on hand required and produces a spreadsheet with two tabs, one for the items needing request with calculated request quantity and the other list for item need not to be requested.
both sheets show last 60 days consumption, current stock on hand as well as current days on hand for each item.
User need to make sure the below source data are in the same working directory as the application:
 1- consumption report.
 2- current stock on hand
 3. robotic system database extract.
